### Example of app features with bad or problematic UI.  

#### 1. Drive PDF Viewer Android Page Slider Feature  
##### 1.1 Bad Things.  
  - **It is hard to go to exact page in a large document\.**  
    Smartphone display are divided into N sections where N is the number of pages. Each section occupied by 1 page. So if you want to go to page 700, u have to drag the pointer to the section that belongs to page 700. The problem is when we want to go to an exact page at a very large document it would be very difficult because each section is just too small.

  - **Slow page movement\.**  
    The slider speed and the abillity of the application to load documents doesnt match well. If the users slide it at very fast speed, the page move at constant rate speed and shown the pages sometimes shows white or black blank screen.

  - **No Alternative\.**  
    The slider is the only way to go to another page quickly. It is the only one option and it is bad.

##### 1.2 Suggestions.  
  - **Add alternative**  
    Add another "Go to page" feature on the header or on the menu bar section. There will be no difficulties caused by slider too sensitive
  
  - **Just use typing method.**
    Typing method is the most simple way to go to another page quickly yet so fast and realiable. Exact page, no difficulties.

##### 1.3 Someone is in trouble.

#### 2. Adobe Acrobat Reader Android Page Pointer Feature  
##### 2.1 Bad Things.  
  - **It is hard to go to an exact page in a large document\.**  
    There reason is same as example number 1. It is hard to go to exact page if each section is too small for human fingers. One movement can skip 1 or 2 section.

  - **The position can makes people accidentally slide it\.**  
    The position of the page pointer is on the right side which many people use right hand as their main hand and the design of the pointer is little bit wide on the side. The problem with this design is the users can accidentally move the page pointer into somewhere else when they just want scroll one page. It is because the pointer is free to move and there is no lock or hide at all.

  - **Hidden feature (maybe)(?)\.**  
    The design of the pointer is like a side note on the page. The design is somewhat suggested users to use it by dragging it. But there is main feature hidden in the pointer where the users can change the page directly by typing it. I have to admit i did not realize it until i accidentally click the page pointer.

##### 2.2 Suggestions.  
  - **Move it to header.**  
    Move the page mover to the header. There is plenty spaces in the header that can be used for "Go to page" feature. There will be no accidental page movement.

  - **Again.. typing method best method**  
    Typing method is the most simple way to go to another page quickly yet so fast and realiable. Exact page, no difficulties.

##### 2.3 Someone is in trouble.

#### 3. VLC Android Settings Feature  
##### 3.1 Bad Things.
  - **Complicated.**  
    The first time i saw it, i am shock. No words, no informations about what settings available. The icon that they use also not too often used by other people. So it is hard to figure what are those setting option.

  - **The Video is still playing.**  
    The video is still playing when users click the settings button. The settings menu block a lot of space on the display so it is annoying.

##### 3.2 Suggestions.  
  - **Use list.**  
    It is better and more informative by using a scrollable list with an icon and some information before or after the settings section. It will clarify and help users to know what settings they want.
  
  - **Pause the video automatically.**  
    Pause the video automatically after the users click the settings menu.
